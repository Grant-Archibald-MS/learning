## Application Problems

### Ratios
**Example Problem:**
A recipe requires 3 cups of flour for every 2 cups of sugar. If you want to make a batch using 9 cups of flour, how many cups of sugar do you need?

**Solution:**
Set up the ratio:
$$\frac{3 \text{ cups flour}}{2 \text{ cups sugar}} = \frac{9 \text{ cups flour}}{x \text{ cups sugar}}$$

Cross-multiply and solve for \( x \):
$$3x = 18 \implies x = 6$$

You need 6 cups of sugar.

### Proportions
**Example Problem:**
If a car travels 150 miles in 3 hours, how far will it travel in 5 hours at the same speed?

**Solution:**
Set up the proportion:
$$\frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = \frac{x \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}}$$

Cross-multiply and solve for \( x \):
$$3x = 750 \implies x = 250$$

The car will travel 250 miles in 5 hours.

### Percents
**Example Problem:**
A store is having a 25% off sale on a jacket that originally costs $80. What is the sale price of the jacket?

**Solution:**
Calculate 25% of $80:
$$0.25 \times 80 = 20$$

Subtract the discount from the original price:
$$80 - 20 = 60$$

The sale price of the jacket is $60.

### Linear Equations with One Unknown
**Example Problem:**
Solve for \( x \): \( 2x + 5 = 17 \)

**Solution:**
Subtract 5 from both sides:
$$2x = 12$$

Divide both sides by 2:
$$x = 6$$

The solution is \( x = 6 \).

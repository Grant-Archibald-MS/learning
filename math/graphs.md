# Plot Points on a Coordinate Plane and Interpret Graphs

## Introduction
In this section, we will learn how to plot points on a coordinate plane and interpret graphs involving linear equations. These skills are essential for understanding and analyzing data in mathematics.

## Coordinate Plane
The coordinate plane is a two-dimensional surface where we can plot points, lines, and curves.

### Axes and Quadrants
The coordinate plane is divided into four quadrants by the x-axis (horizontal) and y-axis (vertical):
- **Quadrant I**: Both x and y are positive.
- **Quadrant II**: x is negative, y is positive.
- **Quadrant III**: Both x and y are negative.
- **Quadrant IV**: x is positive, y is negative.

### Plotting Points
Points on the coordinate plane are represented as \((x, y)\):
- The first number \(x\) is the horizontal position.
- The second number \(y\) is the vertical position.

To plot a point:
1. Start at the origin \((0, 0)\).
2. Move horizontally to the x-coordinate.
3. Move vertically to the y-coordinate.
4. Mark the point.

## Linear Equations
Linear equations represent straight lines on a coordinate plane.

### Slope-Intercept Form
The slope-intercept form of a linear equation is:
$$y = mx + b$$
where \(m\) is the slope and \(b\) is the y-intercept.

- **Slope (\(m\))**: Measures the steepness of the line.
- **Y-intercept (\(b\))**: The point where the line crosses the y-axis.

### Graphing Linear Equations
To graph a linear equation:
1. Identify the y-intercept (\(b\)) and plot it on the y-axis.
2. Use the slope (\(m\)) to determine the rise over run from the y-intercept.
3. Plot additional points using the slope.
4. Draw a straight line through the points.

## Interpreting Graphs
Graphs visually represent data and relationships between variables.

### Reading Linear Graphs
To interpret a linear graph:
1. Identify the slope and y-intercept from the equation.
2. Analyze the direction of the line (positive slope rises, negative slope falls).
3. Understand the relationship between the variables.

## Practice Problems
1. Plot the points \((3, 4)\), \((-2, 5)\), \((-3, -4)\), and \((4, -3)\) on a coordinate plane.
2. Graph the linear equation \(y = 2x + 1\).
3. Determine the slope and y-intercept of the equation \(y = -3x + 4\).
4. Interpret the graph of the equation \(y = \frac{1}{2}x - 2\).

## Summary
In this section, we covered how to plot points on a coordinate plane and interpret graphs involving linear equations. These skills are crucial for visualizing and understanding data in various contexts.

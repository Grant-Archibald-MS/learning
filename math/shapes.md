# Calculating Perimeter, Area, Volumes, and Angles of Basic Geometric Shapes

## Introduction
In this section, we will learn how to calculate the perimeter, area, volumes, and angles of basic geometric shapes. Understanding these concepts is fundamental in geometry and will help you solve various mathematical problems.

## Perimeter
The perimeter is the distance around a two-dimensional shape.

### Rectangle Perimeter
The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is calculated using the formula:

$$P = 2(l + w)$$

where \(l\) is the length and \(w\) is the width.

### Triangle Perimeter
The perimeter \(P\) of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its sides:

$$P = a + b + c$$

where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are the lengths of the sides.

### Circle Perimeter
The perimeter (circumference) \(C\) of a circle is calculated using the formula:

$$C = 2\pi r$$

where \(r\) is the radius.

## Area
The area is the amount of space inside a two-dimensional shape.

### Rectangle Area
The area \(A\) of a rectangle is calculated using the formula:

$$A = l \times w$$

where \(l\) is the length and \(w\) is the width.

### Triangle Area
The area \(A\) of a triangle is calculated using the formula:

$$A = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h$$

where \(b\) is the base and \(h\) is the height.

### Circle Area
The area \(A\) of a circle is calculated using the formula:

$$A = \pi r^2$$

where \(r\) is the radius.

## Volume
The volume is the amount of space inside a three-dimensional shape.

### Cube Volume
The volume \(V\) of a cube is calculated using the formula:

$$V = s^3$$

where \(s\) is the length of a side.

### Rectangular Prism Volume
The volume \(V\) of a rectangular prism is calculated using the formula:

$$V = l \times w \times h$$

where \(l\) is the length, \(w\) is the width, and \(h\) is the height.

### Cylinder Volume
The volume \(V\) of a cylinder is calculated using the formula:

$$V = \pi r^2 h$$

where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height.

## Angles
Angles are measured in degrees and are a measure of the turn between two lines that meet at a point.

### Triangle Angles

The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always  180 degrees.

### Quadrilateral Angles

The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is always 360 degrees.

## Practice Problems
1. Calculate the perimeter of a rectangle with length 8 cm and width 5 cm.
2. Find the area of a triangle with base 10 cm and height 6 cm.
3. Determine the volume of a cube with side length 4 cm.
4. What is the circumference of a circle with radius 7 cm?
5. Calculate the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral.

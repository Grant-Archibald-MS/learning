# Chat with Generative AI

Generative AI, like the one available at https://chat.microsoft.com, allows users to have engaging and informative conversations. Whether you're asking general questions or seeking specific answers, the AI can provide valuable insights and assistance.

## General vs. Specific Queries

When interacting with Generative AI, the type of query you ask can influence the quality and relevance of the response. Here are some examples to illustrate this:

### General Query

**Example:** "Explain the correct answer and the steps to solve it for the following expression."

In this case, the AI might provide a broad explanation that covers various aspects of solving mathematical expressions.

### Specific Query

**Example:** "Explain the correct answer and the steps to solve it for the following expression. Do not use Math Jax format but use plain text in the response."

By specifying that the response should be in plain text and not use Math Jax format, you guide the AI to tailor its answer to your specific needs.
